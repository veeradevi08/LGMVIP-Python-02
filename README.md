# Snake Game

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Snake game using the Turtle module. It was developed as part of a beginner project to explore Python programming and game development concepts.

## Project Description

The Snake game allows the player to control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The game ends if the snake runs into the walls or itself. The score is displayed, along with the high score achieved in the session.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive gameplay using Python and Turtle.
- Responsive controls for snake movement.
- Score tracking and high score display.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the Python script in your preferred Python environment (e.g., Replit).

2. **Controls**:
   - Use the arrow keys (or 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' keys) to control the direction of the snake:
     - **Up**: Press the up arrow key or 'w' to move the snake upwards.
     - **Down**: Press the down arrow key or 's' to move the snake downwards.
     - **Left**: Press the left arrow key or 'a' to move the snake to the left.
     - **Right**: Press the right arrow key or 'd' to move the snake to the right.

3. **Objective**:
   - Direct the snake to eat the red food (represented by a red circle) that appears randomly on the screen.
   - Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer.
   - Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. If the snake runs into the walls or itself, the game ends.

4. **Scoring**:
   - Your score increases each time the snake eats food.
   - The high score achieved during the session is displayed on the screen.

5. **Game Over**:
   - If the snake collides with the walls or itself, the game will reset:
     - The snake returns to its starting position.
     - The score resets to zero.
     - The game resumes with the snake starting again.

## Example

Here's how you can start playing the Snake game in Replit:

1. **Open Replit**: Visit [Replit](https://replit.com/).

2. **Create a New Python Project**: Click on "New repl" to start a new Python project.

3. **Copy and Paste the Code**: Copy the Snake game code into the editor on Replit.

4. **Run the Code**: Click on the "Run" button in Replit to execute your Snake game.
